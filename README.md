## iteration 2
If you like a challenge the map now contains caves. The villagers in a local town will
pay you if you empty the caves, so they can use them as mines. 
But beware if you enter and die you will still die and be lost. 
- Caves are marked by '#'

## iteration 3
Now the game contains weapons. You can buy them in the gameshop, however you have to access them first.
When you empty a cave, you will find a weapon based on the cave's level. This weapon you can buy again from all your heroes.
So after you first access it, it will become available for all users in the gameshop. 
The weapon you find in the cave is almost smashed already, but the ones you buy is all new.

Another thing added to the game is stats. When you kill an enemy, the score will be added to a leaderboard. 
So even when some of your heroes are dead, you can access thier score and compare afterwards.
